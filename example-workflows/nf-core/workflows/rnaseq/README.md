## :warning: !! IMPORTANT !! :warning:
This is a point in time copy of the [NF-Core / rnaseq workflow at version 3.11.1](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.11.1) that has been modified to run on [AWS HealthOmics](https://aws.amazon.com/omics/) and can be used to create a Private Workflow with AWS HealthOmics. More details of how this workflow was modified from its upstream source can be found in the [AWS-HEALTHOMICS.md](./AWS-HEALTHOMICS.md) file.

If you need assistance using running this workflow on AWS HealthOmics, reach out to your [AWS account team](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Introduction

**nf-core/rnaseq** is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse RNA sequencing data obtained from organisms with a reference genome and annotation. It takes a samplesheet and FASTQ files as input, performs quality control (QC), trimming and (pseudo-)alignment, and produces a gene expression matrix and extensive QC report.

![nf-core/rnaseq metro map](docs/images/nf-core-rnaseq_metro_map_grey.png)

1. Merge re-sequenced FastQ files ([`cat`](http://www.linfo.org/cat.html))
2. Sub-sample FastQ files and auto-infer strandedness ([`fq`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/fq), [`Salmon`](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/))
3. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
4. UMI extraction ([`UMI-tools`](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools))
5. Adapter and quality trimming ([`Trim Galore!`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/))
6. Removal of genome contaminants ([`BBSplit`](http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=41288))
7. Removal of ribosomal RNA ([`SortMeRNA`](https://github.com/biocore/sortmerna))
8. Choice of multiple alignment and quantification routes:
   1. [`STAR`](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) -> [`Salmon`](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/)
   2. [`STAR`](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) -> [`RSEM`](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM)
   3. [`HiSAT2`](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) -> **NO QUANTIFICATION**
9. Sort and index alignments ([`SAMtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/))
10. UMI-based deduplication ([`UMI-tools`](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools))
11. Duplicate read marking ([`picard MarkDuplicates`](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/))
12. Transcript assembly and quantification ([`StringTie`](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/))
13. Create bigWig coverage files ([`BEDTools`](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/), [`bedGraphToBigWig`](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/))
14. Extensive quality control:
    1. [`RSeQC`](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/)
    2. [`Qualimap`](http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/)
    3. [`dupRadar`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dupRadar.html)
    4. [`Preseq`](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/)
    5. [`DESeq2`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)
15. Pseudo-alignment and quantification ([`Salmon`](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/); _optional_)
16. Present QC for raw read, alignment, gene biotype, sample similarity, and strand-specificity checks ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/), [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/))

> **Note**
> The SRA download functionality has been removed from the pipeline (`>=3.2`) and ported to an independent workflow called [nf-core/fetchngs](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs). You can provide `--nf_core_pipeline rnaseq` when running nf-core/fetchngs to download and auto-create a samplesheet containing publicly available samples that can be accepted directly as input by this pipeline.

> **Warning**
> Quantification isn't performed if using `--aligner hisat2` due to the lack of an appropriate option to calculate accurate expression estimates from HISAT2 derived genomic alignments. However, you can use this route if you have a preference for the alignment, QC and other types of downstream analysis compatible with the output of HISAT2.

## Usage

> **Note**
> If you are new to nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, you need to prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

**samplesheet.csv**:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R2_001.fastq.gz,auto
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end). Rows with the same sample identifier are considered technical replicates and merged automatically. The strandedness refers to the library preparation and will be automatically inferred if set to `auto`.

> **Warning**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration **except for parameters**; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir <OUTDIR> \
    --genome GRCh37 \
    -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute>
```

For more details, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/parameters).

## Online videos

A short talk about the history, current status and functionality on offer in this pipeline was given by Harshil Patel ([@drpatelh](https://github.com/drpatelh)) on [8th February 2022](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-32-nf-core-rnaseq) as part of the nf-core/bytesize series.

You can find numerous talks on the [nf-core events page](https://nf-co.re/events) from various topics including writing pipelines/modules in Nextflow DSL2, using nf-core tooling, running nf-core pipelines as well as more generic content like contributing to Github. Please check them out!
